To use the Reddit API, you need to create an application on Reddit and obtain your credentials:

1. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. Scroll down and click on **"Create another app"**
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Name**: `Reddit Sentiment Analyzer` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Type**: Select **Script**
   - **Description**: *(Optional)*
   - **About URL**: *(Leave blank)*

4. Click **Create app**
5. After the app is created, copy the following:
   - **client_id**: This is shown just under the app name
   - **client_secret**: This is shown in the app details

You'll use these in your `app.py` like this:

    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    user_agent="Reddit Sentiment Analyzer"

    reddit = praw.Reddit(
        client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        user_agent="Reddit Sentiment Analyzer"
    )

    Enter the subreddit name (without r/)
    
    Select the number of posts to analyze
    
    Check the box to include comments in the analysis (optional)
