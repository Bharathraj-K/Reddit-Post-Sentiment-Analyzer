## üîë Getting Reddit API Credentials

To use the Reddit API, you need to create an application on Reddit and obtain your credentials:

1. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
2. Scroll down and click on **"Create another app"**
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Name**: `Reddit Sentiment Analyzer` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Type**: Select **Script**
   - **Description**: *(Optional)*
   - **About URL**: *(Leave blank)*
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:8080`
4. Click **Create app**
5. After the app is created, copy the following:
   - **client_id**: This is shown just under the app name
   - **client_secret**: This is shown in the app details

You'll use these in your `app.py` like this:

python
reddit = praw.Reddit(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    user_agent="Reddit Sentiment Analyzer"
)



# üöÄ Usage

1. Open `app.py` and replace the placeholders with your Reddit API credentials:

    reddit = praw.Reddit(
        client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
        client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
        user_agent="Reddit Sentiment Analyzer"
    )

2. Run the Streamlit app:

    streamlit run SentimentAnalyser.py

3. In the Streamlit web interface:
   
      
    Enter the subreddit name (without r/) Or Post ID

    To summarize select number of post to summarize

    click the summarize button

    _OR_
   
    Select the number of posts to analyze
    
    Check the box to include comments in the analysis (optional)
